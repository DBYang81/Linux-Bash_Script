# Linux-Bash_Script
Create following (bash) shell scripts and return them here in a single file that has been packaged and compressed. One return per group is enough.

Name the scripts: step1.sh, step2.sh, step3.sh, and step4.sh. Write the scripts so that they can be executed directly (ie. by running ./step1.sh for example).

Script that clears the screen, greets the user by his/her login name, and prints the current date. The greeting must change depending on time (ie. Good morning if time is 8-12, Good afternoon is time is 12-16 etc.).

Create a script that will present a menu for the user where different commands can be run. Commands must include: long file listing of the current working directory, checking how long the system has been on, how much memory is being used and how much is free, disk space usage (whole system), and disk space usage (current working directory).

Build a script that will calculate sums of numbers from 1 through x. Ie. 1 to 5 would be 1+2+3+4+5. User can give the x value as an argument from the command line.

Script that lists, one at a time, all files larger than 1MB under the current working directory. Script should give user option to delete, compress, or skip the file and then show next file. All the deleted files and the time when the delete happened should be listed to a logfile.
